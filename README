~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is for Gráinne of «Stroke» / ICG / «Stroke», whom I will never forget. Sometimes it happens that I talk, for minutes, with someone of whom I know that they understand. I then wish that they and I could meet again, but disappointment has taught me, and it has taught me well. What remains then, is that I think back to them and the time when we met, in all probability, for the last time. And accept that as a gift which is a beautiful thing in itself. ―Andouille.
